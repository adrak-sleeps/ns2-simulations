## NS-2 simulation

**Task-1:**

-Using data from the simulation, give estimates for the mean file transfer times and throughputs of each class based on applying given equation and include confidence intervals in the result.

-Plot results in a graph as a function of 'p'.

-Assumption that RTTs for each class consists of only the propagation delays when applying the DPS model to TCP and comparison on the basis of simulated mean delays and throughputs to the theoretical mean delays and throughputs given by Eq. (9).

-Comparison of ratios of performance for simulations and the theoretical model and conclusion.

**Task-2:**

-Using data from the simulation, give estimates for the mean file transfer times and throughputs of each class based on applying given equation and include confidence intervals in the result.

-Plot results in a graph as a function of 'load'.

-Check the system's behaviour and comparison of ratios of performance for different values of the offered load.
